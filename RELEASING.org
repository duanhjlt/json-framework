#+title: Release Checklist

* TL;DR

  - [ ] Check that tests pass on master
  - [ ] Run AFL for at least 24 hours if changes to the parser
  - [ ] Add release notes
  - [ ] Create tag & fill in github release notes from NEWS file
  - [ ] Update CocoaPods with new release(s)

* Update CocoaPods

  These are further steps to release to CocoaPods because I always forget.
  First install the CocoaPods gem:

  : gem install cocoapods

  Then update our repo to make sure we have the latest version:

  : pod repo update --verbose

  Get latest version of our pod:

  : pod spec cat SBJson > SBJson.podspec.json

  Update version numbers in that, and make any other required changes. Then test
  the changes:

  : pod spec lint SBJson.podspec.json --verbose

  Once happy, push to trunk:

  : pod trunk push SBJson.podspec.json --verbose

  Repeat for SBJson4/SBJson5 as required.
